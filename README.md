# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview
My second JS project.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

- Reading up on JS for email validation
- Planning
- Basic structure (HTML)
- Basic styling (CSS)
- Text-styling
- Button styling (CSS, adjusting for JS later)
- Hover states
- Mobile vs desktop design, media query
- JS
- Finishing touches


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

Respect the regex. Also more understanding of onclick versus event listeners and how to code forms.


### Useful resources

https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php provided the basis for the validateEmail function code and a regex that worked sufficiently well.
